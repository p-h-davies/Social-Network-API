## Installation:

- Ensure you have a Terminator emulator Software installed (such as Terminal for Mac, or Bash for Windows). 
- Ensure you have a code editor, such as VSCode.

Before running the code, it is important to run 'npm i' in your terminal, to ensure all packages are transferred to your machine.

## Usage:
- Open the folder 'Social-Network-api' in your terminal, then type 'npm i' to ensure all packages are working on your machine.
- Next, type "node server.js" to seed the database and start your server.
- Next, navigate to your API Development Platform and enter your desired routes. To view the routes, navigate to the relevant files in the routes/api folder (e.g. category-routes.js).
